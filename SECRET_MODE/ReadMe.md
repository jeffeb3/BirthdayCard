There is a Secret Mode / Easter Egg Mode hidden inside the software loaded onto the birthday card.  As loaded, it doesn't do much.  It was programmed originally as an Easter Egg for my friend to solve when I first created this card.  If you want to change the secret mode, you can modify the code and reupload it to your birthday card (for advanced users only).  

The secret mode is activated by holding down the button while the card is powering on (board v1.3+ only).   Blowing onto the microphone while booting up will also work, but please note, this only works about 25% of the time.  I'm not sure why.  

Secret mode displays a 'secret screen' and plays a 'secret song'
