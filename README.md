As of October 15, the latest version of the Nerdy Birthday Card is v1.3.  Only a handful (~20) of v1.1 and v1.2 were sold as the prototypes.  Mostly everyone will have v1.3.  You can find the version number on the lower bottom of the back of the card.  The versions are almost identical and the code runs exactly the same on all versions.  The two differences in v1.3 is that the button was repurposed from being a reset button to being an input button, which is tied to the same line as the microphone.  And the second difference is that the ICSP port is now through-hole instead of SMT.
